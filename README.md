# Module Questions

This repository is for Module questions for AZ-204. The purpose of having a repo for questions is to have a single
source for editing questions and managing Mentimeter, Kabloom, or other tools to align with the modules and JTA.
The intent of the repository is to allow Course Leads to curate the questions for these formats and include the original question
formats curated by the Content Team.

## Tools

Use VS Code or some other IDE with a Markdown linter to prevent file malformation.

## Styling

Where appropriate the intended styling for tools like Mentimeter or Kabloom will be provided.
